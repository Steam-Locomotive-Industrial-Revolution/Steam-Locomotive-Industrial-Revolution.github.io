        Steam locomotives from the industrial revolution are the precursor of modern trains. 
        The contraption at the heart of these machines is the Steam Engine, which is actually much older than most people realise.
        "Aeolipiles" which were the original form of steam engine were an ancient roman invention, dating from as old as the 2nd century B.C, 
        and consisted of a heated water container with tubes coming off of it, which led to a rotating piece that would release the steam as jets,
        creating torque.

        The Aeolipile, however, is not known to have ever been used for any practical purpose, but simply as a novelty, or a temple wonder, 
        according to some sources. <br/><br/>
        Some of the first known practical uses for steam engines was to pump water. An example of this was Thomas Savery's steam pump, 
        dating from the late 17th century, which was used to pump water from the mines. This pump utilised the suction created by condensed steam, 
        along with hand-operated valves to draw water up. <br/><br/>
        The first person to create a practical and useful steam engine, using the concept of pistons and cylinders was Thomas Newcomen, 
        an english inventor, baptist preacher and ironmonger. His engine was also used to draw water up from the mines, but was fundamentally different in it's
        approach.
